GeoSilk icon set by Rolando Pe–ate
http://projects.opengeo.org/geosilk/_________________________________________

The GeoSilk icon set is derived from the Silk
icon set by Mark James, the Silk Companion set
by Damien Guard, and the uDig icons made by
Jody Garnett of Refractions Research. It aims
to extend the Silk icon set to address the
needs of geospatial software.
