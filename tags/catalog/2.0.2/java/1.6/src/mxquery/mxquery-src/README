        Note for users of Java 1.4/Java5:
        To work around API limitations (especially in Java 1.4), 
        separate JAR files are provided (and can be built) for 
        these platforms. Please use mxquery-14.jar/mxquery-15.jar 

Usage in Java Application Server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc):
		MXQuery.war (a Java web application) can be deployed on 
		any servlet container using the means of the container
		For example on Tomcat, it can be placed into the webapps directory
		It will (normally) become visible under http://hostname:port/MXQuery
		The exported web services will be displayed when invoking this URL 

Usage on mobile devices:
        Run mxquery_midp.jad/jar in your emulator or mobile device
        Runs successfully on WTK 2.5 and several mobile phones
        The included demo application currently runs a hardcoded query
