Building from Source:

        A JDK (not JRE) and ant 1.6.5 or newer required
        
        By default, a "fat" JAR is built that includes all the necessary dependencies
        If this is not desirable, the please remove the "unzip" steps in the jar packaging targets 
        
        1) Standard version (Java 6):
        
        Call ant -f build.xml (which calls the jar target)
          After a successful build, mxquery.jar should be placed into dist/
          
        2) Versions for older JDK/JVM (Java 1.4, Java 5)
    
        Call ant -f build.xml jar-14 or -f build.xml jar-15 
          After a successful build mxquery-14.jar/mxquery-15 should be in dist/
          It is strongly recommended to build using the target JVM version, 
          since newer versions produce bytecode that will run on the older JVM,
          but do not complain if newer APIs are used. 
        
        3) Servlet Container/Web Service Export
        
        	Call ant -f build.xml war. This will create a MXQuery.war in dist/ which can be deployed
        	The build automatically collects the modules/schemas placed in mod2export 
        	and includes them in the WAR file
        
        4) CLDC version
      
        Sun WTK 2.5.2 or newer required (invoked via antenna, included in the
        distribution) - adapt the wtk.home property in build.xml to the 
        installation directory if needed
        Call ant -f build.xml midp_wtk, and mxquery_midp.jad/mxquery_midp.jar are
        built and placed into dist/
        Important: the JAR tool needs to be in the operating system PATH, 
        otherwise preverification will fail with a misleading error
