You need to install the JavaBridge library for printing metadata as pdf file. JavaBridge must be run into an application server
so that java calls from php to build the pdf file are possible.

You should choice between:

1)Running Javabridge into Tomcat application server
Choose this way for production environment for best scalability.
Simply deploy the file JavaBridge.jar int the webapp directory of Tomcat.
Then, configure the easysdi key "JAVA_BRIDGE_URL" to http://host:port/JavaBridge/java/Java.inc
where host:port reflect your Tomcat installation (example localhost:8080)

2)Run JavaBridge into its embeded small application server
Choose this way if you prefer running the pdf creation process into a separate server
Extract JavaBridge.war into a folder of your choice (for ex: /home/usr/me/JavaBridge)
Run the server with the following command (Linux)
java -jar ./WEB-INF/lib/JavaBridge.jar SERVLET:8080 3 JavaBridge.log
(3 is her the log level available from 1 to 5, 8080 is the port, make sure it is available or change it)
Your server is accessible under:
http://host:port
Then, configure the easysdi key "JAVA_BRIDGE_URL" to http://host:port/java/Java.inc


Once you have done this the metadata print PDF feature for EasySDI is available!
